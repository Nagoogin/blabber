# Blabber
Blabs, blurbs, and musings from your mind

##To DO:
* Create a unqiue logo and app icon.
* Find or make better icons in the app.
* Find a theme to make app unique and interesting

A potential idea I (Jung) thought of was a disease idea which I'll explain...

##Blab Plague
When a user blabs, it'll send a notification to anyone who is set to receive blab notifications which will prompt the receiver of the notification to make a quick random blab on the spot. The receiver will be given a short time window to make the blab, no longer than 2 minutes perhaps, which will reward the player in some form (achievement progress/other rewards) if they manage to do so. This will give off a similar chain reaction to more people but each of these subsequent reactions will not send notifications to original blabbers so that the chain only goes in one direction.

This is based off loosely on the idea of diseases (those who were infected are immune/more to future infections of the same disease, while infections rise exponentially).

Why it could be succesful:
* unique
* easy to make achievements and reward users for blabbing
* easy to create huge blab reactions
* no 'like' button or 'reblog' button but instead a victom/infected count from causing reactions which can be an indication to a 'like' or popularity, for example Kevin blabs and Rob and I blab in response which will give Kevin an infection count of 2. In this way there is no need for a 'reply' function because each resulting blab is caused by the original blab and creates a chain/web of blabs that can be trace back to the origin or to one of the many resulting blabs.
* It can be very fun to see where the blab disease originated, (i.e. the Spanish flu originated in Kentucky apparently, in a huge blab reaction, maybe some user in New York was part of a blab disease that originated in Germany)
* Really large blab pandemics/epidemics can be named, like the Kevin's flu or the Robpox.

##Mini Events
Daily:
* 
* 

Weekly:
Disease stories:
* Basic idea: someone starts with a 1 word blab and people add 1 word blab at a time to make a story
* Kevin's plan is to adapt it to disease idea, starts with 1 word which branches to multiple different stories that people vote on for the best resulting story

Random:
Blabbing zombies
* When a user gets randomly tagged as a "zombie" (probably by us/admins), any other users that interact with the zombie blab in some form (maybe blabbing in response or blabbing right after a zombie blabbed in a mini-event), the user will get "zombified" and will create a virtual zombie vs human survival blab war

High Score/Achievements:
Blabbing Away
