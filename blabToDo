To Do:

Logo
Icons (find or make better ones)
Mini-events
Make most recent post unique (light green shading of entire cell is an idea)
Agree on theme: Jung definitely wants to do disease idea


Random rants:

Unique idea for blabs to get chain reactions and increase blab sharing;
need to create a social web so that blabs go around


potential idea:
blab plague - when user blabs, send notification to whoever wants to receive and it’ll prompt receiver to make a quick random blab on spot (given short time window, prob 1~2 min), each subsequent blab gives off a similar reaction but original poster will not get blab prompts so chain is only one direction
	-easy to make achievements based off of this
	-blab plague events based off on size of reaction (i.e. plague, epidemic, etc)
	-no ‘like’ button, but a victim/infected count due to own blab
		if Kevin blabs and Rob and I blab in response, Kevin gets a infected count of 2
		equivalent to ‘like’
